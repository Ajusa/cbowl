                <p class="lh-copy f4-ns f5-m mt3 measure-wide">A six-headed creature in this myth system arose when the legs of a sleeping giant mated with each other. The first clouds in this myth system were formed by taking the brains of a creature sometimes called Blainn and throwing them into the sky. A giant in this myth system is nourished by four rivers of milk produced by an animal that licked salty stones to create the first god. The first giant in this myth system was created in a (*) gap between the land of fire and the land of ice. The creation of this myth system's first man and woman, Ask and Embla, is described in the Gylfaginning, which also describes a cow named Audhumla and a giant named Ymir. For 10 points, name this system of myths featuring gods called the Vanir and Aesir.</p>
